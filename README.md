# ERDOS_EEG_Project

This project is going to look for EEG biomarkers of alcholism. 

The EEG Database on UCI website contains 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) data from alcoholic and control subjects participating in a visual event-related potential (ERP) experiment.  

Subjects were exposed to three experimental conditions: 
- S1 single visual stimulus
- S2m two matching visual stimuli
- S2n two non-matching visual stimuli.  

Each subject participated in multiple trials (replications) of each experimental condition. Data were recorded at 256 Hz for 1 second following the presentation of the visual stimulus/stimuli.
