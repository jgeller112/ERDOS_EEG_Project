# ERDOS_EEG_Project

This project is going to look for EEG biomarkers of alcholism. 

EEG Database on UCI website contains 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) data from alcoholic and control subjects participating in a visual event-related potential (ERP) experiment. Subjects were exposed to three experimental conditions: S1 single visual stimulus, S2m two matching visual stimuli, S2n two non-matching visual stimuli. Each subject participated in multiple trials (replications) of each experimental condition. Data were recorded at 256 Hz for 1 second following the presentation of the visual stimulus/stimuli.
