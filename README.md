# ERDOS_EEG_Project

Analysis is based on a EEG Database Data Set originally created for Kaggle. It contains EEG (Electroencephalography) data for two groups - Alcoholics and Controls. 

 Each subject was exposed to either a single stimulus (S1) or to two stimuli (S1 and S2) which were pictures of objects chosen from the 1980 Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture set. When two stimuli were shown, they were presented in either a matched condition where S1 was identical to S2 or in a non-matched condition where S1 differed from S2.
